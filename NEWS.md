## 0.0.2

Bug Fixes:

- `format_date()` now correctly sorts after the formatting step. This was causing the dates to be sorted as strings, rather than as dates.
- Allows `resume_entry()` for `NA` values in the `details` column. Thanks to @ryanzomorrodi for code submission #2.
- `format_date()` correctly handles `NA` values as the latest date. Thanks to @ryanzomorrodi for code submission #3.
